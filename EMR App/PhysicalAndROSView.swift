// Use the same view for Physical & ROS - when we segue into this view, we will send over whether the query was for 'Physical' or 'ROS' & then configure the view's actions accordingly. Check whether the patient is a male or female & render the view accordingly. We will have an image view on the left (where the TV is located) to show the picture (front & back view of the body), and buttons overlaid on top of the organ systems.

    var gender: Int //check if the currentPatient is male or female
    var viewChoice: Int //check if the input view is physical or ROS
